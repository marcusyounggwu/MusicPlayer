Network Connected MusicPlayer

This MusicPlayer was created for my Software Engineering 1 Course Final Project. Download the zip file, compile and run the MusicPlayerTester.java file to begin. The interface was created using the JFrame library and the packets sent between players are sent through the DatagramSocket class.
